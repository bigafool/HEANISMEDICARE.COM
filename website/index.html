			<div class="row">
				<div class="pharmacy-col">
					<h3>consultation</h3>
					<p>we offer a 30 min consultation with our medical doctors to our patients</p>
					<p>Treatment reflects attempts to help a client. Hence, clinicians rely on assessment information and diagnostic outcomes to make a treatment decision. A clinician may apply a combination of personal and nomothetic (general) information in their treatment plans (Seligman 2004).<br> In addition, factors such as theoretical orientation, available research or new knowledge, evidence-based outcomes and empirically supported interventions may also influence the choice of treatment.<br>
It is believed that the chosen treatment should be effective, but it is necessary to determine the effectiveness of the chosen therapy. Therapies may work for some clients but not others.<br> In addition, harmful therapies are also sources of concern for clinicians and their clients.
						
					</p>
			</div>
	<div class="pharmacy-col">
		<h3>diagnosis</h3>
		<p>we identify the naature of an illness or other health related proplemsby <br>examination of sign and symptoms of the patient</p>
		<p>Clinicians rely on all the available information to determine a clinical condition in a client. <br>These attempts however are guided by their theoretical orientations. Once clinicians have obtained assessment data and determined the most possible condition, they proceed to make diagnosis.<br> Diagnosis reflects the determination of a client’s specific disorder or syndrome.
Effective diagnosis must rely on the available classification system of disorders or syndromes.<br> The systems reflect various categories of disorders, related symptoms, their descriptions and other related issues. <br>The DSM-IV-T is one such system.
Clinicians must however observe potential misdiagnosis and possible consequences on clients and their profession.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="pharmacy-col">
		<h3>prescription</h3> 
		
		<p>we offer medication for certain minor health problems</p>
		<p>Clinical assessment involves collecting of required data from clients with the aim of obtaining a conclusion on their abnormal behaviors. It is effective for determining the cause of abnormal behaviors in a client. Further, it helps in determining effective interventions. Assessment is idiographic (concentrates on the individual person).
Assessment also assists in evaluating effectiveness of treatment and the client’s progress.
It requires specific tools, which are chosen by psychologists based on their theoretical orientations. Although there are many assessment tools, they have been grouped into clinical interviews, tests and observation. Tools, however, can only be useful when they demonstrate reliability and validity, and they are standardized.</p>

These hospital sites have physicians completing their graduate medical education (residencies) from top medical schools, enhancing the scope and level of care Beta Care inpatients receive. Patients are typically admitted to a hospital for an acute illness, traumatic injury, planned surgery, or observation and tests. Most hospital admissions come from the Emergency Department or are coordinated in advance by a patient’s primary care provider. Beta Care also provides inpatient psychiatric services.</p>
